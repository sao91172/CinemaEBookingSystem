Title: Cinema E-Booking System

Overview:
The Cinema E-Booking System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of booking movie tickets online. This project aims to provide users with a convenient platform to browse available movies, browse upcominf movies, view showtimes, select seats, and purchase tickets. Additionally, the system includes features for administrators to manage movie listings, theater information, and user bookings.

Showtimes and Seat Selection: Users can view showtimes for each movie and select their preferred screening time. They can then choose seats from an interactive seating map, with real-time availability updates.

Booking and Payment: Once users have selected their movie and seats, they proceed to the booking and payment process. The system securely handles payment transactions using popular payment gateways, ensuring a smooth and secure checkout experience.

Booking Management: Users can view their booking history by a list of order confirmations. They can also cancel or modify bookings within a specified time window, subject to availability.
